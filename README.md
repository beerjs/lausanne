# BeerJS: Lausanne, Switzerland

Hello and welcome to BeerJS Lausanne! :beers:

Our goal is to build a friendly community by organizing JavaScript meetups in local bars and workspaces. We will talk about the language while enjoying fresh ales and lagers in a laidback atmosphere.

Join us and discover a world of quality code and fine beverages!

Note that **neither drinking beer nor liking JavaScript is required** to participate.

## Inaugural event

We are working on the details of our first event that should take place soon, when people come back from vacation :palm_tree:.

The subject of the event will probably be **JavaScript syntax from the future**. We will be peeking at draft features around a fresh [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_pale_ale) :beer:.

Exact location and time will be announced soon (see timeline below).

For now, **please watch/star this repo to get updates**, [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/beerjslausanne), spread the word and relax.
